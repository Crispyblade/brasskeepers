Swift the [[Aarakocra\|Aarakocra]] Echo Knight was a member of the [[Emerald Order\|Emerald Order]]


**
Swift was dragged into [[Avernus\|Avernus]] and forced to fight in the [[Blood War\|Blood War]], gaining power and experience. While resting after a battle, Swift was approached by a gaunt hooded humanoid figure, with purple skin. Said figure offered Swift an opportunity to “meet” his former adventuring party and “an escape from the torment of the Hells” Swift accepted and found themselves “working” with 5 other members, where it was explained in order to fulfill their contracts, they must slay their designated targets (in Swifts case this is Fortune and Yuumi). Swift being corrupted by the amount of blood and chaos in Avernus he experienced was surprisingly calm about the idea.
