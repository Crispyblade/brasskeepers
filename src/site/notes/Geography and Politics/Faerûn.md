"So as you shiver in the cold and the dark,

_Look into the fire and see in its spark--

_My eye_

_Watching over you._”

— The opening stanza of a time-honored Northern trail song

Northwest Faerûn, generally referred to as the North or even the Savage North, was a region of Faerûn full of untamed wilderness, wracked with difficult winter weather, and home of many hardy folks and fearsome beasts. In spite of this reputation, the North was home to three of the greatest cities in all of Faerûn: Neverwinter, Jewel of the North, [[Geography and Politics/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, and Silverymoon, Gem of the North.

The inhabitants of areas further south, in West Faerûn, described this area in condescension as "the Savage North," which was a reference to the Savage Frontier and a time when its inhabitants were less civilized.
