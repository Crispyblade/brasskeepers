Geography
South of the forest was the village of Grunwald, where the Thunderbeast tribe dwelled within the wood.

To the east of the wood lay the Frost Hills and Mithral Hall, the mining community of Mirabar was west, and the town of Nesmé was to the south-east. The edges of Lurkwood were logged by humans, but its shadowy depths were largely mysterious; plagued with legends of bottomless bogs and deadly quicksand. Beneath the Lurkwood, in the upper [[Geography and Politics/Underdark\|Underdark]], lay the region called the Wormwrithings and many tunnels connecting to the Underdark could be found within the forest.




The Lurkwood, also known as Vurykvudd to the dwarves,was a great, temperate hardwood forest located south of the Spine of the World. It was one of the woodlands that were collectively called the Moonwoods by some in the North.

In ancient times, the Lurkwood was part of the High Forest, but it and many other woodlands were split off by the conflicts of the Crown Wars.

In the late 1350s DR, a variety of unusual monsters were sighted around the Sword Coast North and were tracked back to the Lurkwood, where they'd seemingly emerged. Meanwhile, across Faerûn, similar monsters appeared around the Dragon Reach and apparently originated in the Border Forest. Among these were flying troll-like things, winged undead capable of flight, smoky clouds with multiple retractable arms ending in clam-like jaws and which hunted silently, and intelligent two-headed snakes with tentacles and magical powers—all previously unknown both to local hunters and forest-dwellers and to wider Faerûn. Too big and too numerous to all be supported by forest food sources, and emerging at a steady rate, the monsters were theorized to have been spawned by unidentified magical sources within their respective forests.[

In Eleint of the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR, the gnoll tribe that called themselves the Hoar Fang were destroying large parts of the Lurkwood.The recently empowered Chosen of Mielikki, Jeryth Phaulkon; prominent Harper Bran Skorlsun; a pair of mercenaries; and a force of woodland animals killed all but the tribe's leader and one lieutenant.

Also in the mid-to-late 1360s, the numerous Urlbluk tribe of kobolds attempted to migrate from the Fell Pass to tunnels beneath the Lurkwood. However, at last report, the kobolds had run into violence in the attempt.
