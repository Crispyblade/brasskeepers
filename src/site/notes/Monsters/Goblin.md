**Goblins** were a race of small and numerous [goblinoids](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Goblinoid "Goblinoid") common throughout [Toril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril "Toril"), often living in underground caverns near the surface known as lairs. The race was often, though not always, dominated by other goblinoids, most commonly [hobgoblins](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hobgoblin "Hobgoblin"). Goblins may have, in fact, been initially created by this related race to serve as scouts and infiltrators.
