Gold Dragonborn

Wants to get relics for his church. 

  

May the Goddess of the Sun shine her light to guide your path. This verse can be used in both greeting and when saying goodbye. 

Arion belongs to the golden sect of the Church of the Sun. Members who belong to this sect are charged with going out into the world and finding lost ancient relics strewn across the world. Should said artifact becomes dangerous, it is then their duty to return with all haste to the main church and turn it in to be locked in the forbidden tombs underground

  

[[Religion and Deities/Amaterasu\|Amaterasu]] is good

(Brings clawed-hand to forehead, lips, then heart)

With her teachings, I shall know wisdom

With her blessing, I shall speak truth

With her compassion, I shall love dearly 

I'm thinking of having this be like an oath or an ideal

  

Acolyte of the Church of the Sun, follower of the sun goddess AmaterasuMember of the Golden Order, tasked with the retrieval of lost ancient relics

  
  

While the wording may vary from person to person, all paladins who share this oath are bound by these tenets.

  

The Sun Rises. The Sun has risen each day time immemorial, and so must you. Every day people are in need of your help, and you must be ready to rise for them.

  

The Sun Blazes. The Sun is a source of life, but also dangerous. Remember this, as you must be as well. Aid others and protect the weak, but remember to strike down those whom fear the Sun's light.

  

The Sun Sets. The Sun must set, allowing the world to rest. Remember that even those whom shy away from the Sun's glory, can be redeemed in time. If you believe an opponent can be redeemed, then do so.

Name: Arion Heartstone
Known Nicknames: Arion the Adventurous, Arion the Overzealous, Little Ari
Birthday: June 8th
Class: Paladin
Patron/Deity: Amaterasu
Religious Sect: Golden Sect of the Order of Heavenly Flames

Arion Heartstone is one of the most devout followers of the Order of Heavenly Flames, although such devotion causes him to act recklessly. He has been with the church for the entirety of his childhood, as well as most of his adult life. Arion was found on the doorstep of the church on June 8th. As the church couldn’t approximate an exact date of birth, having been abandoned with no record of his birth, the church decided to take in the young Dragonborn as its ward. They named the church’s newest resident Arion, after one of the church’s founding members. The surname Heartstone was bestowed upon him so that he may never feel the dark resentment that often occurs within those who have been abandoned.
	Growing up as the only child within the church, he had little in the way of playmates, but those who raised him more than made up for it by filling his head with resplendent tales of the great lady Amaterasu. Although Amaterasu is not well known, they keep her within their hearts, minds, and souls.
	Upon waking every morning, Arion would say the prayer taught to every Acolyte. At the tender age of five, he had already memorized the short but powerful mantra:
With her teachings, I shall know wisdom. 
With her blessing, I shall speak true. 
With her compassion, I shall love dearly.
Interspersed through his days filled with chores, he often stole precious minutes hiding in the library, sneaking into the forbidden section of the library to read stories Mother Superior would scold him till the end of days should she catch him. But it was one of the only sources of entertainment for his young brain, living in such a remote and low-populated area.
Another such source was the adventuring bard named Sunny. No one believed that was his real name, but Arion thought it fit the man well, considering his ‘sunny’ disposition. He was the one to encourage Arion to join the Golden Sect, the same as his own, to be able to go out and see the world and all it had to offer. His goal was to spread the wonders of their Lady in hopes of gaining more members. Their church has been suffering as of late due to low funding, Sunny donating every spare coin he could in hopes of keeping their faith aflame.
One day, Sunny embarked on a journey in search of one of Lady Amaterasu’s legendary relics in hopes of bringing renewed faith to the order. Arion waited each day by the gates, hoping to receive a letter from Sunny, yet none came.
Many winters have passed, yet Arion has not faltered in his hopes of one day receiving a letter from [[Characters/Sunny\|Sunny]]. That is until the newly appointed [[Mother Superior\|Mother Superior]] thought to put an end to it.
“It’s past time you stopped lurking at our gate like a dark specter. Do you still believe Sunny is out there somewhere? Then go out and find him, and then bring him home.”
With her blessing, along with some items to help him on the journey, Arion set outside of his home for the first time, excitement and trepidation warring within him. His goal was simple; to find relics of Amaterasu, hoping that he would usher his home into prosperity, but also to find clues of what happened to Sunny a man he considered a brother.
