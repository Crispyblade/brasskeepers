Gold Dragonborn

Wants to get relics for his church. 

  

May the Goddess of the Sun shine her light to guide your path. This verse can be used in both greeting and when saying goodbye. 

Arion belongs to the golden sect of the Church of the Sun. Members who belong to this sect are charged with going out into the world and finding lost ancient relics strewn across the world. Should said artifact becomes dangerous, it is then their duty to return with all haste to the main church and turn it in to be locked in the forbidden tombs underground

  

Amaterasu is good

(Brings clawed-hand to forehead, lips, then heart)

With her teachings, I shall know wisdom

With her blessing, I shall speak truth

With her compassion, I shall love dearly 

I'm thinking of having this be like an oath or an ideal

  

Acolyte of the Church of the Sun, follower of the sun goddess AmaterasuMember of the Golden Order, tasked with the retrieval of lost ancient relics

  
  

While the wording may vary from person to person, all paladins who share this oath are bound by these tenets.

  

The Sun Rises. The Sun has risen each day time immemorial, and so must you. Every day people are in need of your help, and you must be ready to rise for them.

  

The Sun Blazes. The Sun is a source of life, but also dangerous. Remember this, as you must be as well. Aid others and protect the weak, but remember to strike down those whom fear the Sun's light.

  

The Sun Sets. The Sun must set, allowing the world to rest. Remember that even those whom shy away from the Sun's glory, can be redeemed in time. If you believe an opponent can be redeemed, then do so.
