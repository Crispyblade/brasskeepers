Female

Tiefling Rogue

Looking for wealth




Cousin: [[Characters/Hope Goldblossom\|Hope Goldblossom]]

 I think her overall plan in regards to her family situation is to use whatever notoriety she's earned from slaying a dragon plus whatever she can get from Acquisitions Inc. and combine it with stealing the family seal and maybe some forging of Uncle Thinker's signature to place herself as the head of the family then use said position to loosen the rules and allow Hope (and her other family members she's add on as an afterthought) to live however they please. (A similar result could be achieved by just waiting for Hope to inherit then having Hope pass it on to Fortune immediately, but that plan was discarded for taking too long and not having enough Pizzazz)

I think I'll say her full name is Fortune [[Businesses and Organizations/Goldblossom\|Goldblossom]] and the Goldblossom Family owns a few farms and a number of mines (probably not the one in Phandalin though). While the real-world reason Fortune never mentioned her family name is I hadn't thought of one, the in-game reason will be that Goldblossom is a well-enough known name that she'd be recognized pretty easily and she wants to both keep the majority of her family from noticing what she's been up to (and if her name was recognized word would get back to them) and she wants to make a name for herself without people giving her handouts to attempt to curry favor from her family or thinking of her as some prissy rich girl. This was made simpler by the fact that many Tieflings don't have surnames so if she acted like she didn't have one no-one would question it.
