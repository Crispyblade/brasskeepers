**

He started off innocent enough with a mom and a step-dad. He was a good boy until one day at I don't know, 16, he makes a pact with something or someone wanting to be a warlock, not knowing what he's getting into. He's had to do things he regrets since then that keep him up at night now. What he wants more than anything now is to find a place he belongs now. He's still not sure if that place is Brass keepers inc. Or not yet

From the city of [[Geography and Politics/Jhaansciim\|Jhaansciim]], a desert town on the coast

Patron made him hurt innocents.

Patron is a [[Monsters/Dao\|Dao]] genie he rescued from a lamp. Said Dao also screwed him over.

“ The first was when he worked with some miners in the desert. I worked with them for multiple days before I took all the gems I could find for my patron before intentionally collapsing the cave, trapping all the miners inside.

(I actually had this idea for a long time but never thought I'd need to mention it.)

Many times I'd rob caravans or travelers at the edge of my blade or using magic. But the next act Is what got Harlinem the nickname 'The angel of death' in the desert.

There was a very prosperous desert village at the edge of an oasis by the name of Muska. They had lots of diamonds and gold. He set fire to the village houses and slew anyone that fled. The Dao said no witnesses were allowed.

Afterwards I took the diamonds with a very guilty conscience, but I had to. Or else my patron would punish me.

When I met the current party I thought I could run away from my past. But it's come back to haunt me now.

I planned on stealing from them too but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Not after I got to know everyone”
