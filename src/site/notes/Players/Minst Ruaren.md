Birthday: 12/29

Minst Ruaren was born in [[History and Myths/Shadowfell\|Shadowfell]] in the town of [[Geography and Politics/Obleris\|Obleris]] roughly three hundred years ago to [[Characters/Joan Ruaren\|Joan Ruaren]] and [[Characters/Nicholas Ruaren\|Nicholas Ruaren]]. She had a good relationship with both.
She left Shadowfell after her father died.

Though Minst's childhood was relatively normal and she had a small handful of close friends she left [[History and Myths/Shadowfell\|Shadowfell]] a long time ago as it is a very dreary and joyless place especially after her father died, so she ended up joining up with a minstrel troupe for a while. However Shadowfellâ€™s influence is plain to see as Minst herself appears almost perfectly neutral at all times with the exception of when she is fighting, dancing as an entertainer, or occasionally when getting paid. She naturally fell in with a group of ruffians who showed her how to get what you want through sneakiness rather than direct confrontation, and what to do as a plan B if sneaking failed.

This almost directly led to her also taking up moonlighting as a mercenary and assassin for hire after she parted ways with her troupe which has led to her doing a good number of notable deeds for coin, including saving a church being attacked by undead snakes, stopping a gang of kidnapping circus performers, disrupting a ritual in a sand temple to turn the whole world into sand, exploring an abandoned school of magic and defeating the illusions within, defending an airship carrying dangerous cargo from sky pirates, and lastly she defeated a Revenant in a castle of ice. While she has done many many more small simple jobs these are the most memorable and elaborate.

Over the course of her long life she has had several lovers, but is unlikely to settle down or retire from adventuring anytime soon and typically reacts poorly to anyone who questions her along those lines.

She is a [[Classes/Warlock\|Warlock]] of the [[Religion and Deities/Raven Queen\|Raven Queen]]
