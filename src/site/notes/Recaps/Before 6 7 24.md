**6/7/23

  

The party finished clearing out the dungeons underneath Tresander Manor. They rescued two survivors, the Splingfig sisters, spell component merchants who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They also rescued Gilda Dunn, majordomo of the previous company here. She states that she saw her friend, Talanath, the previous occultant of the Mongooses, touch a timepiece and vanish during the attack. The party also saved a kobold, Patski a member of the attacking groupi, who had been left behind by the attackers after he was petrified by some undead cockatrices.  
Finally, the party found a discarded piece of paper, after rubbing charcoal on it, they found that it was a letter addressed to someone named, S. The The letter stating that the tiefling escaped, and the timepiece was undiscovered. The letter is signed, Hoobur

Beneath the signature is the symbol of a draconic skull pierced by a sword from the bottom up.

6/14/23

The party received their company positions, and the deed to their new manor. Along with a hefty amount of gold to spend, and newfound financial responsibilities. Gorkoh arrived suddenly, as Jim Darkmagic, of the new hampshire darkmagics ™, teleported him, saying the party owed him a favor. Paxti went on leave to see a new friend in the woods, should be back soonish. Harbin Wester offered the party some help in the form of free laborers, also blackmail . Party hired Macklin Talctuft as a foreman for the construction, possibly long term. Party uncovered the collapsed passage, and followed it through, finding themselves deep in the woods. They found an ogreess and her two wolves in a cave, before retreating back to the manor.

  

7/5/23

Long recap cause it's been a while.

  

The Party had taken care of business in Phandalin, recieved their company positions, hired employers, and henceforth are now known as the Brass Keepers. 

Additionally, the Party received info about the attack on the old owners of their new manor, the Golden Mongoose. They learned that an Ogre was hired amongst others to quote "destroy". According to Gilda Dunn, the old major domo (and new major domo of the brass keepera) the attackers were looking for some sort of timepiece, which her friend Talanath three coins grabbed during the attack, causing her to vanish but leave the timepiece behind. Gilda kept it for safekeeping, before it was found by the Brass keepers and Myr took possession of it.

  

They left for never winter to check out the Jamain Families mines, which were rumored to be overrun by goblins (the Jamains being involved in a potential arranged marriage with Fortune, specifically one Lord Cruller Jamain, an aspiring young wizard). 

  
  

Party left for never winter, were ambushed by a group of goblins on the road. Party was victorious, captured one goblin for interrogation.

They were also given a job by their boss at Acquisitions, Omin Dran, to find one Opal Descart, who was securing some treasure for Acquisitions in Neverwinter. [  Yeah, so I’m going to need you to do a little extra work for me. It shouldn’t be too taxing. I have a contact in Neverwinter who’s secured a cache of treasure. Her name is Oppal DeScart, and you can usually find her in a tavern in the Blacklake District known as the Stable Quiver. She’s a shapeshifter, so I can’t say for sure what she’ll look like when you locate her. You can suss her out with the passphrase “That’s a big hen house,” and she should reply with “Only to a small fox.” When you locate her, tell her that it’s safe to “Move the cargo along the Platinum Road.” And that’s it. She’ll give you the treasure to get out of Neverwinter safely. The whole affair should take a few hours, and then you can be on your way. You can get the goods to me when you return.”]

  

8/11/23

The party met up the people that had sent the letter, turns out these were members of the Zhentarim Guild, an extremely infamous criminal organization. They revealed they were also looking for Opal, and proposed a partnership. In return for information regarding Opal’s stash of wealth, the Zhentarim guild would provide resources in the form of information and manpower to break Opal out of jail. Currently, the party has just finished their long rest, and are planning on doing a preliminary scouting of the prison with Beck and Yumi, posing as some of Opal’s friends / family

  

8/25/23

WORM

Party killed a purple worm, followed the tunnels through to a secret entrance to the prison, broke oppal out of jail. Oppal told party the package was in a book in the Neverwinter Hall of Knowledge (Library). Oppal then proceeded to get the shit kicked out of her by Lemmy and to a lesser extent Harlinem (actually all Lemmy). Harlinem and Lemmy struck a deal, harli would be pronounced dead by worm, to escape from the Zhentarim guild, and so he could join the Brass Keepers. 

  

9/15/23

Beck interviewed Harlinem, went to library, planning on how to break into the forbidden wing, heard a boom downstairs, saw a book floating, with two gargoyles attacking guards,

  

9/22/23

SHOPPING

Beck got some fancy ideas for some fancy weapons, also met on of his Grandpa's old friends / apprentices. 

Minst got some fancy new armor 

The party discovered that there is a diamond shortage due to the goblin infestation of the Jemaine family mines

Minst took Beck to the church of Selune and oh look Beck is cursed again, this time by some magic artifact he picked up back at the sinkhole in Waterdeep. Said artifact has been altering Beck's personality go be more chaotic and to explore the different planes of existence.

  

10/6/23

The party made their way to the Jemaine Family mines, discovered after talking to the guards on duty that Lord Cruller had gone in a few weeks ago to negotiate and hasn’t come out since. Fortune’s father Light Goldblossom, also went in to negotiate and see what had happened to Lord Cruller a few days ago, also hasn’t come out yet. The party snuck their way into the mine, and began clearing out the goblins.

10/13/23

The party made their way to the Jemaine Family mines, discovered after talking to the guards on duty that Lord Cruller had gone in a few weeks ago to negotiate and hasn’t come out since. Fortune’s father Light Goldblossom, also went in to negotiate and see what had happened to Lord Cruller a few days ago, also hasn’t come out yet. The party continued to clear out the goblins in the Jemaine Family mines. However, while they were exploring a narrow passageway, they came across a variety of mushrooms that had sprung up in the passageway. Continuing on, the party felt lightheaded and momentarily lost consciousness, waking up to find themselves in a strange swamplike forest, the din of fireflies and cicadas in the background, the brightness of the flowers around them, and about 50 feet away, a large mad hatter-esque table, seating 3 humanoid figures, a male human, an older male tiefling, and a strange male humanoid, with elflike features, strong chiseled jaw with handsome face, his hair is long and unkempt, seemingly the color black, but as the light shifts, it changes to a brownish red color. As he looks upon you all, his eyes seemingly fixate upon Yumi, before exclaiming, “Ah, my guests are finally here. And I see you’ve brought my niece. Welcome to, the Feywild!

  

10/20/23

The party was whisked into the Feywild after going through the Jemaine family mines. There they met Vofanes, who turns out (or at least he says he is) Yumi’s Uncle! He’s extremely pissed that the Keepers killed all the goblins inside the mines, as he and the Goblin courts were apparently working on a pet project. Instead of killing everyone here, instead he decided to give them a mission out of the kindness of his own heart (mostly cause Yumi was here), bring back some of his pet displacer beasts that had wandered too close to the court of summer. After an encounter with a massive Feymire crocodile, the party found themselves in a quiet part of the swamps, right outside of what seems to be a strange hut, all alone out in the woods.

  

11/3/23

Party walked away from the hut. The party continued out into the feywild woods where they came across a suit of armor out in a clearing. Upon investigation, the suit attacked them! After defeating the armor, it was revealed to be Sildar Hallwinter, one of the mayoral candidates of Phandalin, who seemed to have been trapped in the Feywild for an unknown amount of time. After taking a quick rest, the party and Sildar continued onwards.

  

11/17/23

Continuing on through the woods, the party came across a Pixie Circle, finding what seemed to be Reshy!, and some other guy named Jimmy. Reshy had apparently been dragged along by Myr and two others, an Eladrin female, and a male half-elf. Something occurred and Reshy was separated, with very little idea of what had happened, only seeming to feel a pull to the Summer Courts of the Fey. The party chatted, blew up some pixies that Beck had tricked, and came across the ruins of the town Cendriane. Harlinem and Fortune did some exploring, aside from some spooky stuff happening and some dead spiders, nothing was really found of note.

  
  
  
  

12/8/23

While the party was sleeping, Yumi had a weird dream.

When the party woke, Sildar and Jimmy were gone. After doing a walk-around the town, after about an hour the party noticed Beck was also missing. 

  

12/15/23

The party had gone down into an observatory after Yumi had a dream. There they found a group of giants, redcaps, and a goblin who seemed to be calling the shots reactivating long dormant portals. The goblin left the giants to deal with the party. After a long-drawn out battle, involving an aboleth who had jumped through one of the portals, the party managed to deactivate the portals, seemingly stopping someone’s plans from occuring.

Beck also had a run-in with a hag, or THE hag, old Baba Yaga, a.k.a Babushka. The hag offered Beck in return for his friend’s deaths, his mom would be revived. After much deliberation, Beck refused the hag’s offer, and returned to save his friends from almost assuredly certain death. 

  

1/5/24

Last session, the party discovered that Reshy’s friends were kidnapped by Queen Titania, leader of the Summer Courts. They hatched a plot to sneak in, hopefully without being caught. Unfortunately, as they were leaving Titania was waiting for them. After a harrowing conversation, Fortune Goldblossom, managed in a high stakes and risky game of cards, won the party’s freedom. After their escape, they met back up with Vofanes who teleported everyone back, including Fortune’s father, Lord Cruller, and Sildar Hallwinter. After a tearful reunion between Fortune and her father, and a discussion about the future, the party returned to Honeydew Ranch for a much needed rest, it seemingly still being the Feast of the Moon, only a few hours having passed during their feywild journey.

  

1/19/24

After a long trek through the Feywild, the party returned home (after only a few hours aghhhh). They took care of some housekeeping, got Harlinem and Arion introduced to most of the town, and their employees. They received some letters, some from home, some business deals, and a distress letter from Wizzey Fotz, leader of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint. As they were planning on going to bed for the night, they heard a scream in the middle of town, and discovered that there were two Sildaars! The rest of the town soon crowded around everyone to investigate. 

  

1/26/24

The party through some clever thinking and stealth managed to discover that Harbin Wester, mayor of Phandalin was in league with Vofanes. Also discovering that one of the Sildaar’s was actually Timothy! 

They managed to resolve the situation quickly, and teleported to Silent Sound Lighthouse to rescue Wizzy Fotz. 

  

2/2/24

After a teleportation mishap, the party arrived at the beach surrounding Silent Sound Lighthouse, where they discovered a ship being harassed by a baby kraken. After repelling the Kraken, the party talked with the crew of The Tortured Tortle, and discovered they were smugglers, turned pirates.The captain of the Tortured Tortle seemingly turned the crew into horrible pirates, performing activities such as slavery. The party promised to try and return after taking care of business at the lighthouse. Outside the lighthouse, they found tents that had been lived in, and ransacked recently. Inside the ground floor, they found a ghost of one of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint, hovering near maps of trade routes, seemingly pointing to a secret headquarters of Dran Enterprises in Luskan, a city to the north of Neverwinter. Dran Enterprises seemingly being responsible for the attack on Tresendar Manor, as well as a journal by Wizzy Fotz stating they had found a magic clock lately.

  

2/9/24

The party found the necromancer! The necromancer, a gnome by the name of Hoobur Gran’Shoop. He was very polite and welcoming, offering the party Chamomile tea and beer. He revealed that he was the one responsible for slaying the Order of the Stout Half-Pint, and also revealed he worked for Dran Enterprises. He commented that he loved the plucky can-do attitude of the heroes,  and offered to let the party leave with Talanatha and Wizzy in tow. The party said fuck that necromancy bad and attacked. 

  

2/16/24

After a LOOOOONG fight, Hoobur escaped via teleporting out. The party began to clear out the rest of the dungeon, revealing an old mage’s workshop, who seemed to have a fascination with automata and Mechanus. After destroying the mage’s prized mecha chimera, the party rescued a chained up Modron, who had been trapped down here for who knows how long, cut off from the hivemind of Primus. After calling Jim and requesting a favor, the Modron left for waterdeep.

  

2/23/24

After successfully rescuing Wizzy and Talanatha from the necromancer Hoobur Gran’Shoop, the party met up with the crew of the Tortured Tortle, and assisted in the mutiny. The crew dropped off the party outside of Luskan, the city of sails leaving the party to take care of business, such as uncovering and infiltrating the location of the secret Dran Enterprises Headquarters that they learned about in the lighthouse thanks to information from the Stout Half-Pint, and also recent attacks on Acquisitions Incorporated franchises indicating that Dran Enterprises was responsible. Information from Hoobur pointing to Dran Enterprises being responsible for the attacks and also having a keen interest in acquiring the Orrery of the Wanderer, the strange artifact in the possession of Beck. and also to find where the auction that Harlinem’s patron asked them to “acquire”

  

3/1/24

Short session. Helped out the cart driver Dabahl and the bard Noriel. Discovered that Dran Enterprise Agents frequent a tavern to the North of the city, along the River Mirar.

  

3/8/24

Shortish session. The party found the Fishbone Tavern, and discovered some information on Dran Enterprises HQ. After helping out a man with a serious case of gangrene, the party was told to go to the Peg and Hook and talk to the owner Arla, who had previously worked for the company. The party also decided to stay the night at the tavern, and were attacked in their sleep by mysterious masked figures. After slaying the assassins, the party moved to another tavern, and rested.  
  

  

3/15/24

The party rescued Arla from some Dran Enterprise Employees that had been sent to silence her. There the party learned that the HQ entrance was aboard a ship down at the docks. The party infiltrated the ship after some clever disguising, and found that they had been beat, as they found a slain guard in the portal hub, with his brain sucked out. 

  

03/22/24

After doing some portal hopping, the party found themselves at their target location, the secret HQ of Dran Enterprises. Waiting for them was a lizardfolk named Brachus. Brachus claimed that Dran Enterprise was not the party’s enemy, and offered two components of the Orrery, as well as information on their true enemy if the party kept him alive, as 3 figures teleported in, a mindflayer flanked by two drow. 

  

4/5/24

Christmas Party! The party met their co-workers. The so called C-Team of Acquisitions. 

  

4/12/24

The party broke into Beck’s home to do some investigating, where they found Brighton’s experimental creations, strange metallic constructs as well as familiar replica Modrons. After fighting through the lab, the party chanced upon a teleportation circle that Brighton seemed to have been using, leaving behind knowledge for Beck stating to “come find him when he’s ready”, as well as information on how to create teleportation circles.

  

4/26/24

  

The party hired a tortle for security: Eldol. 

  

6/7/24

After breaking into the vault at the wedding, the party discovered that the orrery component was a fake! After revealing the illusion, all that remained was a satchel full of strange coins and a letter from someone named Lottie, who stated that she possessed the remaining orrery component, and if the party seeked to destroy the artifact then an ally / informant could be found in her. Lottie specifically could be found in the destroyed town of Fortune, past the Greypeak Mountains far to the east.**
