Party went to explore [[Characters/Hoobur Gran'Shoop\|Hoobur Gran'Shoop]]'s new lair in the [[Religion and Deities/Raven Queen\|Raven Queen]]'s catacombs

Tiera:

**

We’re at our mansion in [[Geography and Politics/Phandelin\|Phandelin]]. [[Players/Arion Knightsbane\|Arion Knightsbane]] immediately goes to the “bar” AKA the kitchen to drown his woes in alcohol. Our NPCs + players are trying to prevent him from drinking the wrong unhealthy things.

He goes to the temple of coin to attempt to confess sins, but they aren’t really that kind of temple and the lady doesn’t wanna handle it now. She said he can come back in the morning and try.

  

[[Players/Yumi Honeydew\|Yumi Honeydew]] wild shapes into a wolf (after asking about Amaterasu) and convinces drunk Arion to go home and sleep it off

[[Religion and Deities/Amaterasu\|Amaterasu]]

Well, she appears as a young maiden most of the time, with flowing white hair and a kind smile. Whenever I've seen her in the past, she would wear a white robe with a hood covering her eyes

Sometimes, she appears as a wolf

  

[[Geography and Politics/Lurkwood\|Lurkwood]]: Logging forests that Neverwinter uses. Deeper into Lurkwood, dark and shadowy and creepy. Tales of quicksand, bogs, etc not  super explored.

27 roll: possibly connects to the Underdark. Monsters, gnolls, kobolds, etc in the woods.

  

[[History and Myths/Undead\|Undead]]: very wide and broad “status” or species; hard to pin down what they’re weak towards. Shadowy ones tend to not like light. Really dislike divine energy, but also kinda drawn to it. 

Pack of werewolves in the eastern part of the woods. 

  

Yumi scrys:

[[Characters/Hoobur Gran'Shoop\|Hoobur Gran'Shoop]]: packing up? Almost finished with what he’s working on? He notices the scry though and says hi, expects company soon.
