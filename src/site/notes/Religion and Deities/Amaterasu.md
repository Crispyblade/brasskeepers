"Amaterasu is good

(Brings hand to forehead, lips, then heart)

With her teachings, I shall know wisdom

With her blessing, I shall speak truth

With her compassion, I shall love dearly"

- Prayer to Amaterasu as depicted by a [[Classes/Paladin\|Paladin]]


Amaterasu, also called Amaterasu Omikami and Light of Heaven and titled the Great Goddess of the Rising Sun and simply the Sun Goddess, was the goddess of light and the sun (including the dawn and dusk. She preceded Lathander and her worship is all but dead.

Description
She appeared as a beautiful human woman with, of course, a radiant smile. She also could appear as a ball of fire or a white furred wolf.

Personality
Though considered fragile and to have had a limited upbringing, Amaterasu was curious and forever fascinated by the Prime Material Plane and by the Outer Planes as well. She worried about events on the Prime and sought to understand other deities of the sun. She was known to have great pride but also great gentleness.

Activities
The twin siblings Amaterasu the sun goddess and Tsukiyomi the moon god sat with their backs to one another, and thus marked the difference between day and night. Amaterasu caused solar eclipses as omens. Amaterasu weaved robes for her fellow gods to wear.

Symbols

Amas icons range from a bright sun, to a wolf on fire standing in front of a sun

The lone wolf represents the solidarity between Ama's worshippers, and the sun represents the shared connection between all of them. Even continents apart there will always be a sun to guide and warm them

Worshipers
Her clerics could be male or female, and they wore green vestments and kept their heads uncovered.

She was worshiped at her temples and propitiated with handicrafts on a semi-annual basis. Her holy days were the summer and winter solstices.
