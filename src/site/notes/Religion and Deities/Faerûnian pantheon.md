"Lathander to light,  
Selûne to guide,  
Kelemvor to judge,  
And passage provide"
-A common Faerûnian household prayer

The Faerûnian pantheon was a very fractious one that fought among themselves and had no overarching goal. This fractious nature was believed to be the source of the pantheon's adaptability and its ability to expand. When it expanded its physical sphere of influence, it usually did so at the expense of other pantheons.

The aforementioned Circle of Greater Powers regulated the deities according to the rules as set by Ao, the overgod of Toril to whom all pantheons worshiped on Toril were subject to. However, the leaders rarely (if ever) convened to carry out their duties. On the occasions where they did convene they were slow to act, not because of deliberation but because of conflict between each other.
