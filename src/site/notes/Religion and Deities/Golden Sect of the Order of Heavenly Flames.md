While the wording may vary from person to person, all paladins who share this oath are bound by these tenets.

The Sun Rises. The Sun has risen each day time immemorial, and so must you. Every day people are in need of your help, and you must be ready to rise for them.

  

The Sun Blazes. The Sun is a source of life, but also dangerous. Remember this, as you must be as well. Aid others and protect the weak, but remember to strike down those whom fear the Sun's light.

The Sun Sets. The Sun must set, allowing the world to rest. Remember that even those whom shy away from the Sun's glory, can be redeemed in time. If you believe an opponent can be redeemed, then do so.

**It is said that there are twelve sects within the Order of the Heavenly Flame, each residing over a certain tenet. Known sects are Green (Clerics, rituals), White (Priests, healing), and Gold (Warriors, adventure). There is talk of a secret Black sect, dealing in assassinations and the darker side of Amaterasu, but has not been confirmed.**
