“The Raven Queen is trapped by her fascination with the past. She sits in her fortress, amidst all the memories of the world, looking at the ones that please her most as though they were glittering jewels. Many great wizards have attempted to understand her motives, but like a raven she has always remained cryptic, keeping her cache of secrets just out of their reach.”
— Alustriel Silverhand


The Raven Queen, Matron of Death, also commonly known as the Matron of Ravens and the Duskmaven, is the goddess of death, fate, and winter; she is also considered the goddess of twilight, inevitability and the passage of time, presiding over the transition between life and death. Originally a mortal woman, she ascended to godhood and destroyed the previous god of death. After her ascension, her true name has long been lost. Her devotees seek her favor to guide them in death and prevent the curse of undeath from falling on them.

She was also a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell who was revered by the shadar-kai and by people in mourning who wanted their deceased loved ones be protected from becoming undead as well as by people who worship her as a goddess of fate and appeal to her to alter their fortunes.


Blood, which plays a large part in the ritual of communing with the goddess within her temple, is one of many very powerful tools in the worship of the Matron of Ravens and sometimes blood magic is utilized by her followers

Appearance

When she was alive, the Raven Queen was described as a beautiful woman with raven hair. After becoming a goddess she is described as a tall and slender woman with flowing black hair and pale, porcelain skin. She almost always wears a blank porcelain mask. On the rare occasions she removes it, she is still described as beautiful and pale, and her eyes have red irises.

Symbol
Her general iconography represents the way in which the goddess appears to mortals, almost always adding elements of black feathers such as a cape or wings. However, certain sects in Anauroch (in which she is worshiped as Duskmaven) depict her as a keen-eyed vulture with plumage varying from the shades of a sunset to the black of midnight; in this representation, the goddess also covers her face, in this case with a golden funerary mask.

Personality
As a mortal, the Raven Queen was an ambitious and determined mage, daring to face the previous god of death and determined enough to stay with him, developing the Ritual of Seeding and taking his position in the pantheon.

The Raven Queen was obsessed with collecting and observing mementos and fragments of memories and essences. Many sages speculated that she was in fact insane, believing her methods and behavior little more than aimless curiosity or a desperate attempt to prevent her fragile existence from fading into oblivion. Others maintained that there was a cosmological function that was performed by the Queen's actions, as she purified souls by forcing mortals to deal with their fears and pains. It was believed that her true intentions were only known to the Lady of Pain.



**Commandments of the Matron of Ravens**

- _Death is the natural end of life. Grieve the fallen, but do not pity them. Exult in the time that they were granted._
    
- _The path of Fate is sacrosanct. Those who pridefully cast off destiny must be punished._
    
- _Undeath is an atrocity. Death is too good a punishment for those who pervert the rightful transition of the soul._
