"Ah, humans, now. There’re a lot of us, to be sure, flung far across all these lands, and more besides, across the sundering seas. We battle like [orcs](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orc "Orc") and dream like [elves](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elves "Elves") and work harder than all but the [dwarves](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarves "Dwarves") at their forges—and we cover [Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn "Faerûn")."
Olram Faravaerr, Merchant of [Mintarn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mintarn "Mintarn")


**Humans** on [Toril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril "Toril") were widespread, could be found in most regions and, in general, were fierce and disagreeable, which could sometimes lead certain other races to view them with contempt. They were renowned for their diversity and ambition, and although they lacked specialization, they could excel in many areas.
